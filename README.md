#### Vision Statement
   This product is targeted for the sickly among us, who need a one-stop shop for diagnoses and specialist research for treatment. The product, a medical application called SickoSearch, simplifies the process of looking up an illness and narrowing down the appropriate specialist to treat that illness.  Unlike the alternatives, our product integrates features of other competing alternatives into one convenient platform.  Unlike WebMD and MedScape, it provides a bridge from your illness to a specialist directly. Unlike Doctor On Demand, this app is for those who want an actual face-to-face visit with their doctor. 
  
   Our targeted audience for this app is those who find adulting particularly difficult when it comes to medical issues, those who don’t want to or can’t juggle multiple look-up platforms (like the elderly or those not technologically proficient), and also potentially those who are new to an area. SickoSearch offers what usually multiple apps would do, but in a singular app.
